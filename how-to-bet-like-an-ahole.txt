Showing cost per stupid move on a $10 bet (cost per time you do the
wrong thing, that is)

TODO: 1 more sig fig, check #s, consider multiple hits

Taking hits when you're not supposed to pisses stupid people off most.
  hit 12 even if dealer shows bust ($0.27)
  hit 13 unless dealer shows 5 or 6 ($0.40)
  hit soft 18 unless dealer shows 7 or 8 ($0.57) (but this is rare)
  hit 13 when dealer shows 5 or 6 and 
      14 unless dealer shows 5 or 6 ($1.00)
  hit 14 when dealer shows 5 or 6 and
      15 unless dealer shows 5 or 6 ($1.50)
  hit 17 when dealer shows 8, 9 or 10 ($1.57)
  screw it. hit anything less than 17, always ($1.23 avg, max $3.30)

Not hitting isn't as good because of asym superstition. but cheap!
  don't hit: 16 ever or 15 if dealer shows 9,10,A ($0.21)
  never hit 15 or 16 ($0.32)
  never hit! (12 or more) ($0.84)
 
Splitting tens!
  you must split tens when dealer shows a 6 ($0.10)
  split tens when dealer shows 7 or less ($1.10)
  split everything but 5s and 10s
  split everything unless dealer shows 10,A

Doubling alot
  double down on 10,A always
  double down on 9 if dealer shows < 9
  double down on 8 if dealer shows bust
  double down on 7-12 if dealer shows bust
  double down on 4-13 if dealer shows 5,6
  double down on A2-A8 if dealer shows bust
  double down on A9 if dealer shows bust
  double down on A6 always
  double down on A7 always
  double down on soft anything (but BJ) if dealer shows < 9

Hit when you should stay
  hit soft 18 when dealer shows 2,A
  hit 12 when dealer shows bust [4,5,6]
  hit 12-15 when dealer shows 2,3
  hit 12-14 when dealer shows 4,5,6
  hit 17 when dealer shows 8,9,10

Why so cheap to hit A8 (19) when dealer shows an A?
Bug?
The A8 wins 53% of the time and pushes 13%, so call it 60% winning.
(TODO: But then why is the expected return < 1?)
